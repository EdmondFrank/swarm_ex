# SwarmEx - Elixir Agent Orchestration Library

## Overview and Objectives

SwarmEx is an Elixir library for lightweight, controllable, and testable AI agent orchestration. The library provides primitives for creating and coordinating networks of AI agents, leveraging Elixir's native strengths in concurrency and fault tolerance.

### Core Design Philosophy
- Clean, idiomatic Elixir implementation
- Emphasis on composability and extensibility
- Clear developer experience
- Robust error handling and observability
- Leverage Elixir's built-in process communication patterns

## Target Audience

- Elixir developers building AI agent applications
- Teams requiring robust, scalable agent orchestration
- Developers familiar with the Python `swarm` library looking for an Elixir alternative

## Core Features and Functionality

### Client (Main Supervisor)
- GenServer-based implementation for state management
- Manages agent lifecycles
- Handles timeouts and error recovery
- Provides supervision tree integration
- Maintains context variables between agent handoffs
- Independent client instances per agent network

### Agent Behavior
Required callbacks:
- `init/1` - Agent initialization and setup
- `handle_message/2` - Process incoming chat messages
- Tool-specific handling callbacks
- `handle_handoff/2` - Manage agent transitions

### Tool Integration
- Declarative tool configuration in agent modules
- Support for various tool types (code interpreter, retrieval, etc.)
- Configurable retry mechanisms for failed tool invocations

### Error Handling
- Proper use of Elixir supervision strategies
- Tagged tuple returns for clear error handling
- Configurable retry strategies for tool invocations
- Clear error messaging for handoff failures
- Support for alternative agent specifications

### Observability
- Comprehensive telemetry integration
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Client state inspection capabilities
- Health and performance metrics

## Technical Stack

### Core Dependencies
- Elixir >= 1.14
- Potential integration with:
  - `instructor_ex`
  - `openai_ex`

### Key Elixir Features Utilized
- GenServer
- Supervisor
- Behaviours
- Process communication
- Telemetry

## Conceptual Data Model

### Client State
```elixir
%SwarmEx.Client{
  context: map(),
  active_agents: map(),
  handoff_history: list(),
  network_id: string()
}
```

### Agent Configuration
```elixir
%SwarmEx.Agent{
  tools: list(),
  state: map(),
  options: keyword()
}
```

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Client GenServer implementation
- Basic agent behavior definition
- Simple message passing between agents
- Initial testing framework

### Phase 2: Tool Integration
- Tool specification and configuration
- Tool execution framework
- Retry mechanism implementation
- Error handling for tool operations

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Context variable management
- Handoff mechanics
- Alternative agent specification
- Documentation and examples

### Phase 4: Observability
- Telemetry implementation
- Logging framework
- Health metrics
- Debug utilities

### Phase 5: Production Readiness
- Performance optimization
- Extended testing
- Documentation finalization
- Example applications

## Security Considerations

- Proper handling of sensitive context variables
- Secure tool execution environment
- Validation of inter-agent communication
- Rate limiting and resource management

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Complex State Management
Solution: Clear separation of concerns between client and agent states, with documented patterns for state updates

### Challenge: Tool Execution Reliability
Solution: Robust retry mechanisms and clear error reporting

### Challenge: Testing Complexity
Solution: Comprehensive testing utilities and example test suites

### Challenge: Performance at Scale
Solution: Proper use of Elixir processes and optimization of critical paths

## Future Expansion Possibilities

- Custom tool development framework
- Additional agent patterns and templates
- Integration with more AI providers
- Advanced monitoring and debugging tools
- Distributed agent networks
- Agent visualization tools

## Next Steps

1. Setup project structure and basic dependencies
2. Implement core client GenServer
3. Define and implement agent behavior
4. Create basic testing framework
5. Document initial implementation
6. Gather community feedback
